#Arithmetic operators.

#operators
a=10
b=20
print(a+b) #addition operators.
print(a-b) #substraction operators.
print(a*b) #multiplication operators.
print(a/b) #division operators.
print(a**b) #Exponents operators.
#This operators use for to find square root of any number like if you want to find square root of 5 i.e(5x5) but in this operators suppose if you want sqaure root of 5 then simply you have to use this operators by doing like this 5**2 (2 means multiplication of 5 twices times)

print(a//b) #Floor Division operators.
#actual ans is 0.5 but use this opertors its gives you integer value not a float.
#this operators use for if you get out put in decimal but if you that float or decimal value in it integer then use this 'FLOOR DIVISION OPERATORS'
#e.g if you divided 10 by 3 you'll get output in float like this 3.33333 something but after using this operators you'll get out put in integer value that is 3.
